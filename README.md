# Movie_recommender_system

# Overview
The movies are recommended based on the content of the movie you entered or selected. The main parameters that are considered for the recommendations are the genre, director, and top 3 casts. The details of the movies, such as title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, casts, etc., are fetched from TMDB.

# Similarity Score
How does it decide which item is most similar to the item user likes(or selects in our case)? Here comes the similarity scores.

It is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.

# Cosine Distance
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.

# Conclusion
* With this process we got a recommendation system.
* This is helpful for recommending similar movies on basis of thier content.
